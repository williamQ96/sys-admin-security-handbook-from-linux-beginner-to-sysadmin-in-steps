# System Administration & Security Handbook

Welcome to the "System Administration & Security Handbook" GitHub repository! This handbook is a comprehensive guide derived from my CS 410 System Admin & Security final project, taught by Dan Carrere at the University of Oregon. It serves as a starting point for aspiring system administrators and security experts.

## What is System Administration?
System administration involves managing and overseeing the operational aspects of a computer system or network. Sysadmins are tasked with ensuring that these systems are efficient, secure, and meet the needs of the organization.

## Why Open Source?
This handbook is open-source to foster a community-driven approach to learning and sharing knowledge. Open sourcing doesn't mean relinquishing credit; I retain authorship and acknowledgement for my work. It means the material can be freely used, adapted, and distributed, with the proper attribution to the original source.

## How Can You Contribute?
Your contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

- **Fork** this repository to make your own version.
- **Star** this project if you find it useful.
- **Comment** with feedback, suggestions, or questions.
- **Contribute** to future development.

## Future Development Plans
I'm planning to further enhance the aesthetic appeal, unify the style, enrich the content, and incorporate more images. I aim to include applications of Linux in real-world scenarios, along with self-project guidance, and practical tips like the importance of regular system updates.

Additionally, there has been interest shown by a Chinese learning group, and as such, I'm considering translating the handbook into Chinese and other languages based on availability and demand.

## How to Use This Handbook?
Currently, the handbook is provided as a PDF file, which you can download and use as a reference guide. As the project develops, more interactive or user-friendly formats may be considered.

## Questions or Comments
If you have any questions or comments about the handbook, feel free to open an issue in this repository, and I will respond as promptly as possible.

Thank you for your interest and support in making system administration and security knowledge more accessible!
